# z80
A csharp and swift emulator for the Zilog Z80 CPU.

## The project

z80 a Z80 emulator that works in real time written in C# and Swift.

These are contained:

* Z80 Emulator (`Z80`)
* Z80 Assembler backend (`Z80Asm`)
* Zilog-based Z80 tests (`z80.Tests` for C#, `Tests/z80Tests` for Swift)

The tests are a translation of the documentation, the assembler backend is needed to write tests and stay sane and the emulator is the whole point. 

There's a very basic step debugger in the tests (`TestSystem`) which basically came for free with them.

## Usage example C#

```csharp
var ram = new byte[65536];

// Load a ROM image
Array.Clear(ram, 0, ram.Length);
Array.Copy(File.ReadAllBytes("48.rom"), ram, 16384);

// Ports is something you supply to emulate I/O ports
var ports = new SamplePorts();

// Set up memory layout
var myZ80 = new Z80(new Memory(ram, 16384), ports);

// Run
while (!myZ80.Halt)
{
    myZ80.Parse();
}

// Show the registers
Console.WriteLine(myZ80.DumpState());
```

## Usage example Swift

Add repository as a package to a Swift project.

```swift
```

### Run Swift test suite

- Open terminal window on MacOS, Linos or Winos
- Clone repository and CWD into TL folder
- Exec `swift test` command

## Status

Test Coverage: **98.29%**  
Spectrum ROM: **_Apparently_ it works**, but needs a ULA to work.

### Opcodes


The following opcodes are supported

* 8-bit load group (e.g. `LD A, 0x42`)
* 16-bit load group (e.g. `POP HL`)
* Exchange, Block Transfer, and Search group (e.g. `EX AF, AF'`)
* 8-Bit Arithmetic Group (e.g. `ADD 0x23`)
* General-Purpose Arithmetic and CPU Control Groups (e.g. `NOP`, `HALT`, ...)
* 16-Bit Arithmetic Group (e.g. `ADD HL, 0x2D5F`, ...)
* Rotate and Shift Group (e.g. `RLCA`, `RLA`, ...)
* Bit Set, Reset, and Test Group (`BIT`, `SET`, `RES`)
* Jump Group (`JP nn`, `JR e`, `DJNZ e`, ...)
* Call and Return Group (`CALL`, `RET`, `RST`)
* Undocumented opcodes (`CB`, `DDCB`, `FDCB`, `ED`)
* Input and Output Group (`IN`, `OUT`, ...)

### Other features

These other features are supported

* Address and Data bus
* R register counts machine cycles (approximately)
* Interrupts
* Other pins


## The future

The following opcodes are not done

* Undocumented opcodes (`DD`, `FD`)
* Undocumented effects (`BIT`, Memory Block Instructions, I/O Block Instructions, 16 Bit I/O ports, Block Instructions, Bit Additions, DAA Instruction)

These new features are highly desirable

* An assembler frontend thus having a full z80 assembler
* A disassembler based on the current CPU emulator code

Also, the project should have NuGet packages at some point.
